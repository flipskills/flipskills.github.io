introduction: >-
  We are back in Canada enjoying the fall colors after an amazing time
  travelling and doing many workshops with wonderfully engaged and appreciative
  participants. We are happy to report that contemporary ideas of dynamic
  leadership and followership are being embraced all over the globe with all
  different types of organizations - from schools in South Africa to European
  banks. Organizations want more collaboration and fuller engagement. People
  want more influence and to make a difference.

  This month's ideasletter examines the leadership/followership dynamic in
  collaborative decision making. How are you showing up in both your roles?

  Generatively,

  Samantha & Marc

  Leadership Is Half The Story -  available now in bookstores and online
  bookstores all over.
