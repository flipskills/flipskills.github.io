			<h3>Leadership is Half the Story: Collaborate Better</h3>
			<p>Can you imagine a choreographer training only one dancer to lead while his or her partner sits in the lobby staring at the wall? Unthinkable? Yet this happens all the time within organizations. Half the partnership is missing! All of us lead, not just those with the formal title. All of us follow, not just frontline staff. What’s more, leadership and followership are dynamic roles. This empowering perspective opens up leadership to everyone, elevates followership, and enables more productive and innovative collaborations. Based on the book, Leadership is Half the Story, we offer a host of new ideas and practical tools for everyone in an organization – from CEO to HR director to front-line manager to consultant. </p>

			<h3>Building Followership & Better Organizations</h3>
			<p>Imagine you had a secret formula for your business. One that could improve sales, production, quality, revenue per employee, and customer satisfaction by 17% to 43%. What would it be worth to you? What would it mean for your organization? How much would you be willing to invest in that opportunity? In a world that’s constantly changing, it’s striking that there has been no new major leadership theory since 1979. 21st Century workplaces require a radically different leadership approach, one that not only maximizes leadership capabilities, but also followership capabilities.</p>

			<h3>Kirk vs. Spock: Making Better Decisions</h3>
			<p>Are you on a mission to seek out better decision-making, to boldly go where no one has gone before? We face dozens of decisions every day, from the ordinary to those more akin to intergalactic warfare. Decision-making is a skill with many facets: When is enough analysis enough? How do you move a process forward? How can you have the most positive influence? And how can you harness the most value from your crew? The Starship Enterprise has two great decision-makers on board: Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock. Develop the best skills from both of them in this 25th century view of decision-making.</p>

					<li><p>Make better decisions and speed up their implementation</p></li>
					<li><p>Create an optimal decision-making environment that engages the whole team</p></li>
					<li><p>Use the latest research in neuroscience to improve your influence on any decision</p></li>

			<h3>Don’t Be a Sea Squirt and Eat Your Brain: Building Greater Agility</h3>
			<p>A sea squirt starts life looking like a tadpole with gills. It has a primitive nervous system, a whip-like appendage that helps it move called a notochord, and a small ‘brain’. When the juvenile sea squirt finds a place to settle, it attaches to the surface then proceeds to eat its eye, its notochord, and its brain! There it stays happily, unless there is a change in the environment. Any change, however, means it will die. While the sea squirt was perfectly adapted when it first settled in, it subsequently lost its agility. </p>
			<p>We work in an era of unprecedented change—organizations need to be agile, as do the people within. Not having agility is rather like settling down in one place as a sea squirt: deadly. In this workshop we restore eyes, attach notochords, and build new brains! </p>
			<div class="gain-points">
				<h5>Gain Points</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Learn about the three pillars of the agility framework and build more of each</p></li>
					<li><p>Get everyone ready for change</p></li>
					<li><p>Support personal and career growth through skill development with immediate impact </p></li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Rock It Like The Beatles: Building Better Teams</h3>

In just eight short years, the Beatles released 27 studio albums, 19 compilations, numerous singles, and wrote songs that have sold well over a billion units worldwide! While each of the Beatles had individual success later on, it was their remarkable teamwork that was the backbone for the greatest single outpouring of popular music in our time.</p>
