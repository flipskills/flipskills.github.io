			<h2>FliP University</h2>

			<p>Did you know that online course completion rates are roughly 6%? Our goal is to radically change this statistic from 6% to 90%. That’s why we’ve launched FliP University (or FliP U for short).</p>

			<p>We find people doing online professional development fall into one of three categories: Victims, Vacationers or Valedictorians. What category do you see the most of at your organization? And would that change if they had an online learning experience that was fun, interactive, practical, cutting-edge AND academically sound?</p>

			<p>Soft skills are hard! But learning them should be fun, relevant and rooted in science.</p>
